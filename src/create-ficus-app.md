# Create Ficus App

Set-up a web app with FicusJS quickly and easily.

## Getting started in seconds

When you want to get started with FicusJS and web components, Create Ficus App lets you focus on code, not build tools.

To create a project called my-app, run this command:

```bash
npx create-ficus-app my-app
```

This will create a project using the Snowpack app starter project.
