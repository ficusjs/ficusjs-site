# Renderers

Minified ES module renderers for FicusJS web components.

A `renderer` function can be provided when creating a new FicusJS web component.
This allows any renderer to be plugged into a component.

The following renderers have been tested with FicusJS and are available as minified bundles in this package to make working with them much easier.
