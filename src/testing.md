# Testing

The [FicusJS testing](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ficusjs/testing) package provides lightweight helper functions for web component testing.

This package provides browser globals such as `window` and `document` using [jsdom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsdom) which is an implementation of many browser APIs ideal for testing but is not an actual browser.

We recommend using a tool such as [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for browser end-to-end tests.
