# Testing

The [FicusJS testing](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ficusjs/testing) package provides lightweight helper functions for web component testing.

This package provides browser globals such as `window` and `document` using [jsdom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsdom) which is an implementation of many browser APIs ideal for testing but is not an actual browser.

We recommend using a tool such as [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for browser end-to-end tests.

## Running tests

This package contains functions intended for a NodeJS environment and not a real browser. It is therefore, best used for fast iteration.

The functions can be used with any NodeJS testing framework.

The following functions are available in the [FicusJS testing](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ficusjs/testing) package.

- `init` - a function for initializing the test environment
- `render` - a function to render a web component for testing

### init function

The `init` function initializes the NodeJS environment ready for testing.

Simply call `init` in your set-up hook.

```js
import test from 'ava'
import { init, render } from '@ficusjs/testing'

test.before(init)
```

### render function

The `render` function will create a new web component instance for testing.

It returns a DOM instance of the component.

```js
import test from 'ava'
import { init, render } from '@ficusjs/testing'

test.before(init)

test('render basic component', async t => {
    const comp = await render('basic-comp', () => import('../src/component.mjs'))
    t.is(comp.querySelector('p').textContent, 'Basic component')
})
```

The `render` function accepts the following arguments:

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tagName` | `string` | The web component tag name |
| `importer` | `function` | A function that registers a web component. This can return a `Promise` |

## Testing components

Testing web components can be done in a number of ways.

- verifying that a component renders without throwing using a "smoke test"
- shallow rendering and testing component output
- full rendering and testing component lifecycle and state changes

It is a good idea to start with creating basic smoke tests for your components.

Testing that a component mounts and ensures that it doesn't throw during rendering provides a lot of value with very little effort.
